# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog 1.1.0](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning 2.0.0](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

Because purepdb is a *parser*, one thing worth stating about what those version
numbers cover: the public API is the surface listed in `purepdb.__all__`. The
numbers a given release extracts from a given PDB are not part of it — recovering
more symbols from the same file is an `Added`, not a breaking change, even though
`len(pdb.functions())` moves. A release that made a previously-resolved address
resolve *differently* would be breaking, and would say so here.

## [Unreleased]

### Removed

- **Python 3.11 is no longer supported**; `requires-python` is `>=3.12`. Nothing
  in the parser needed 3.12. The MCRIT ecosystem now shares a 3.12 floor so one
  interpreter serves every component.

## [0.5.0] - 2026-08-28

### Added

- `MsfFile` and `PDB.from_bytes` accept any buffer — `bytes`, a `memoryview`,
  or an `mmap.mmap` — rather than `bytes` alone. Reading a handful of streams
  out of files that run to hundreds of megabytes is what a memory map is for,
  and the annotation was the only thing standing in the way; the container
  reader needs a length, slicing and the buffer protocol, all of which a
  mapping has. The magic test that names a Portable PDB or an MSF 2.00 file
  now slices rather than calling `startswith`, which a mapping does not have —
  losing that branch would answer "bad magic" for every Portable PDB in a
  swept directory. A memoryview is normalised to a one-dimensional view of
  bytes first, because `len()` and slicing on one count *elements*: a view cast
  to four-byte elements measured a file at a quarter its size and had it
  rejected as truncated, and a strided view, whose bytes are not the file's at
  all, is refused as an `MsfError` rather than left to raise `BufferError` out
  of `struct`.

### Fixed

- A stream directory whose block map spans more than one block is read instead
  of rejected. The map starts at `BlockMapAddr` and runs over as many
  consecutive blocks as its indices need; assuming one raised `MsfError` on a
  valid file — a hard rejection, which is worse than this parser's usual
  failure mode of an empty result. Found on a real 127 MB PDB with a 1024-byte
  block size, whose 497 directory blocks needed 1988 bytes of map. It now parses
  clean: 3354 streams, 63000 procedure records, 55147 functions, no malformed
  records and no truncations. `tests/_synth.py` had the mirror-image assumption
  and would silently resize its own buffer past the block it had reserved.
- The `diagnose()` warning that the globals index and the module walk disagree
  fired on 18 of the 39 readable PDBs in a 2.5 GB corpus with nothing missing
  from any of them, and asserted a conclusion it could not reach: *"Both
  describe the same set, so one of them is being read incompletely."* They are
  not the same set. The index also names managed methods — 16 of those 18 files
  are managed, where every `S_PROCREF` points at an `S_GMANPROC` that purepdb
  reports as no native procedure, which the warning about managed code already
  says — and import thunks, whose module stream carries `S_THUNK32` rather than
  `S_*PROC32` and which `functions()` reports anyway, as an alias of the public
  at the same address. `diagnose()` now resolves every ref to the record it
  points at and warns only on the ones nothing accounts for, naming the kind it
  found. `Diagnostics.proc_ref_targets` is that classification,
  `Diagnostics.unresolvable_proc_refs` the refs whose target could not be read
  at all, and `Diagnostics.unmatched_proc_refs` the sum the warning fires on. A
  warning that fires on 46% of real files teaches a reader to skip the list,
  which is what the entries that matter are then lost in — the same reasoning
  that took the thread-local warning out in 0.4.0.
- `dev/validate_against_llvm.py` reported two files as disagreeing with
  `llvm-pdbutil` where the comparison was the thing at fault, which is what the
  first nightly cross-check run turned up. A dump the tool declines to produce
  — `--section-contribs` on a PDB with no section-header stream — is now a
  skipped check with its reason printed, not a failed file that took the three
  checks after it down with it. Inline-site ranges are rebuilt from the
  annotation deltas, because `llvm-pdbutil` advances its cursor past the length
  of a standalone `ChangeCodeLength` and not past the one fused into
  `ChangeCodeLengthAndCodeOffset` — which is invisible on a file using the
  first and shifts every range after the first on a file using the second. And
  an inlinee name is left out of the comparison for a file the tool reports no
  ID stream for, since it then resolves every item id against the TPI and
  prints the name of whatever type shares the index. The whole seven-file
  corpus agrees again: the syzygy fixture compares all nine checks, and the
  slot-5-less one compares the seven that do not need a section-header stream
  instead of stopping at the sixth.

## [0.4.0] - 2026-08-24

### Added

- `S_LABEL32` decoding: named code addresses inside procedures — assembly
  labels, exception continuation targets, interrupt-return points. `PDB.labels()`,
  `Label`, `codeview.LabelSymbol`, and `Diagnostics.labels`. They are
  deliberately *not* merged into `functions()`, because a label is an address
  within a body that already has an entry point.
- Thread-local variables: `S_GTHREAD32`/`S_LTHREAD32` are decoded and reported
  by `PDB.thread_locals()`, which is deliberately separate from
  `data_symbols()` rather than part of it. A thread-local's `segment:offset`
  addresses the TLS initialisation template, not the variable — which has no
  address in the image at all — so the field is `template_rva` rather than
  `rva`, and the two are not comparable. `ThreadLocal`, `ThreadLocalSymbol`.
- `PDB.compile_info()`: the S_COMPILE3 record of every module, naming the source
  language, the target CPU and the compiler's own version string. The language
  field states what a caller otherwise has to infer from the shape of the
  mangled names — a Rust module says `Rust`, and the linker's own contribution
  says `Link`. One record per module is the common case but not the rule: an
  import library arrives as a single module holding the records of every member.
  `purepdb.CompileInfo`.
- CLI subcommands for the listings that had none: `data`, `labels`, `thunks`,
  `trampolines`, `inline`, `lines`, `constants`, `udts`, `modules`, `thread`
  and `sections`, beside the existing `functions`, `publics`, `info` and
  `diagnose`. Output is one record per line with stable leading columns and the
  name last, since a name may contain spaces; counts, warnings and usage go to
  stderr, so a redirected stdout holds records and nothing else. `purepdb
  --help` lists every command with its columns, generated from the table the
  CLI dispatches on.
- A `diagnose()` warning for a BBT-processed PDB that carries the pre-BBT
  section table (Optional Debug Header slot 10) and no section headers (slot 5).
  Symbol RVAs are final, post-BBT addresses, while the only section table left
  to display is the pre-BBT one the map translates out of — two address spaces,
  both looking like RVAs, with nothing previously marking the mismatch.
- `diagnose()` accounts for every record purepdb drops. `malformed_records`
  now covers each kind with a parser rather than only publics, procs and data;
  `Diagnostics.undecoded_constants` covers a constant whose numeric leaf is one
  purepdb does not decode, which loses the name with the value; and
  `Diagnostics.unplaced_inline_sites` covers a site whose annotations describe
  no code. Each has a warning, so no record can now go missing in silence.
- `Diagnostics.thread_local_records`, reported by the `diagnose` subcommand with
  a note that `thread_locals()` and not `data_symbols()` is where they are.
  Deliberately not a `warnings` entry: a binary using thread-local storage is an
  ordinary binary, and every other sentence in that list names something wrong.
- `Diagnostics.pdb_info_error`, and a warning when the PDB Info stream cannot be
  read — the named-stream map lives in it, so `named_streams()` comes back empty
  and `/names` cannot be found, both silently until now.
- Fixtures: `tests/data/tls/`, a freestanding x64 pair carrying both
  thread-local record kinds, with the four template addresses cross-checked
  against the initial values in the image;
  `tests/data/rustpe32/rust_pe_symbols_i686_no_slot5.pdb`, which reaches the
  Section Map fallback from a committed file rather than by clearing a slot at
  runtime; and `tests/data/syzygy/`, output from Google's Syzygy `relink`
  carrying 1228 real OMAP entries. The last is the first third-party material in
  this corpus, Apache-2.0 and attributed in `NOTICE`.
- `tests/_relink.py` and `tools/relink_omap.py`, which move function bodies in a
  copy of one of our own fixtures and write the tables describing the move —
  slot 10, slot 5 and both map directions — so that OMAP translation is checked
  against moved bytes rather than against arithmetic chosen on both sides. The
  PE oracle then applies: the address purepdb reports must hold the function it
  names.
- `dev/validate_against_llvm.py`, which cross-checks purepdb against
  `llvm-pdbutil` record by record — procedures, publics, labels, constants,
  UDTs, the section-contribution table and the module attribution built on it,
  every `file:line` entry, and every inline site with all of its code ranges.
  It skips cleanly when the toolchain is absent and exits non-zero on any
  disagreement. A nightly CI job runs it; it is deliberately not run on pull
  requests, where a reference-tool version bump would fail unrelated changes.
- `dev/validate_omap_against_windows.py`, which checks OMAP translation against
  Windows system binaries and the PDBs Microsoft's symbol server has for them.
  Nothing is redistributed: the images are the developer's own and the symbols
  land in an untracked cache. The oracle is the export table, written in the
  shipped image's own address space. Over eighteen pairs spanning XP, 7, 10 and
  11, `ntdll` agrees on 99.8%–100% of its exports, and **0 of 8730 exports match
  the untranslated address** on the pairs that carry a map.
- `docs/`: three write-ups, each figure measured against a committed fixture.
  `omap.md` on Optional Debug Header slot 10 and the one place in this format
  where a missing stream gives wrong addresses rather than missing ones —
  including that no Win10 or Win11 PDB carries a single OMAP entry, so the
  practice ended between Win7 and Win10; `reading-real-pdbs.md` on what real
  files do that the format documentation does not say; `validating.md` on how
  any of it is known.
- `AGENTS.md`, describing the project for agents and humans working in it.

### Fixed

- `PDB.info()` rejects a PDB Info stream shorter than the 28-byte header it
  reads, with `MsfError`. The stream's length comes from the file, so it is a
  bound the file can lie about, and nothing checked it: below 12 bytes the
  read leaked `struct.error` out of the public API, and between 12 and 27 it
  did not raise at all — it returned a **short GUID**, which is the more
  serious half, since a truncated GUID is exactly what a caller would key a
  symbol-server lookup on.
- `PDB.info()` refuses a PDB Info stream older than VC70 with
  `UnsupportedPdbError` rather than reporting a GUID. That layout has none:
  the named-stream map begins where the GUID now sits, so the bytes reported
  were the map's own. `llvm-pdbutil` refuses such a file outright.
- `purepdb info` reports both of those instead of ending in a traceback: the
  Info stream is read after the file is opened, so guarding only `PDB.open()`
  left it uncovered.
- `PDB.data_symbols()` reports each symbol once. A module's stream and the
  symbol-record stream both describe a file-static symbol, and the globals
  stream repeats a few of its own, so the listing counted 633 records as 633
  symbols on sqlite3 x86 where the file describes 481. A record is dropped
  only when name, segment, offset *and* kind all repeat; the surviving set is
  identical to what `llvm-pdbutil` prints across `dump --symbols` and
  `dump --globals`, deduplicated the same way.
- `.gitignore` had `.pytest_cache/` and `fuzz-failures/` joined into one line,
  so the pattern matched only the literal path `.pytest_cache/fuzz-failures/`
  and the fuzzer's saved inputs were not ignored.

## [0.3.0] - 2026-08-14

### Added

- OMAP address translation, so RVAs match images whose code was moved after
  linking by BBT. `PDB.omap`, `PDB.original_sections`.
- Section Map fallback: when the section-header stream is absent, addresses are
  rebuilt from DBI's Section Map rather than every RVA coming back `None`.
  `PDB.derived_sections`.
- Section contribution attribution — `Function.module` names the `.obj`, library
  member, or `Import:foo.dll` an address came from. `PDB.section_contributions()`,
  `PDB.module_of()`.
- `S_PROCREF`/`S_LPROCREF` decoding: every procedure indexed from one stream.
  `PDB.proc_refs()`, `PDB.resolve_proc_ref()`.
- `S_CONSTANT` and `S_UDT` decoding. `PDB.constants()`, `PDB.udts()`.
- Thunks and trampolines. `PDB.thunks()`, `PDB.trampolines()`; `S_THUNK32`
  records now reach `functions()` with `source="thunk"`.
- Line information: `rva -> file:line` via the `/names` string table and the C13
  subsections. `PDB.lines()`, `PDB.string_table()`, `PDB.named_streams()`.
- Inlined functions from `S_INLINESITE`, with names resolved through the IPI
  stream. `PDB.inline_sites()`, `PDB.id_table()`.
- Truncated and malformed record streams are reported rather than silently
  ending a listing. `Diagnostics.truncations`, `Diagnostics.malformed_records`.
- A 32-bit `rust-lld` fixture, which is what shows the `code_publics` rule is
  not an x86_64 accident.
- `tools/fuzz.py`, which drives every public entry point over malformed input
  and fails if anything but `PdbError` escapes.
- Continuous integration: tests on 3.11–3.14 plus macOS and Windows, ruff, ty,
  an sdist round-trip, and fuzzing on every change and nightly.
- `diagnose()` reports the globals' procedure index (`Diagnostics.proc_refs`)
  and warns when it disagrees with the module walk — the two describe the same
  set, so a disagreement means one is being read incompletely.
- `diagnose()` reports how much C13 line info a PDB carries
  (`Diagnostics.line_bytes`, `has_string_table`) and warns when the data is
  present but `/names` is not, which is the one way `lines()` yields nothing
  from a file that plainly has line info.
- `diagnose()` reports a module list that stopped at a record it could not read
  (`Diagnostics.module_list_stopped_at`), rather than a short list looking like
  a genuinely short one.

### Changed

- The truncation warning distinguishes a stream that abandoned readable bytes
  from one that merely ran out with fewer than four left. Only the first loses
  symbols; the second is padding or a file cut inside a header, and the two are
  indistinguishable. `codeview.Truncation.ragged_tail` carries the difference.
- The Section Map reconstruction now stands down for the original section table
  in slot 10, not only for slot 5. Addresses are unaffected — the resolver
  already preferred the real table — but `diagnose()` no longer reports a
  reconstruction on a file whose addresses came from the file.

- **Requires Python 3.11 or newer.** 3.9 and 3.10 are no longer supported;
  3.9 has been end-of-life since October 2025.
- Development tooling moved from the `dev` extra to a PEP 735 dependency group.
  Install it with `pip install -e . --group dev`, not `pip install -e '.[dev]'`.
- `PDB.to_rva()` is public; it was `_rva`, which is retained as an alias.

### Fixed

- An OMAP table present without the original section table no longer
  double-translates an already-final address into one no symbol occupies.
- A present-but-empty section-header stream is treated as absent, so the Section
  Map fallback runs instead of every RVA silently coming back `None`.
- A malformed stream directory raises `MsfError` instead of leaking
  `struct.error`, and an unterminated module name no longer raises `EOFError`
  out of `PDB.open()`.
- A short IPI record no longer raises `EOFError` out of `PDB.inline_sites()`.
- `Function.module` is populated for thunk-created functions, which previously
  depended on a redundant proc or public happening to share the address.
