# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog 1.1.0](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning 2.0.0](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

Because purepdb is a *parser*, one thing worth stating about what those version
numbers cover: the public API is the surface listed in `purepdb.__all__`. The
numbers a given release extracts from a given PDB are not part of it — recovering
more symbols from the same file is an `Added`, not a breaking change, even though
`len(pdb.functions())` moves. A release that made a previously-resolved address
resolve *differently* would be breaking, and would say so here.

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- OMAP address translation, so RVAs match images whose code was moved after
  linking by BBT. `PDB.omap`, `PDB.original_sections`.
- Section Map fallback: when the section-header stream is absent, addresses are
  rebuilt from DBI's Section Map rather than every RVA coming back `None`.
  `PDB.derived_sections`.
- Section contribution attribution — `Function.module` names the `.obj`, library
  member, or `Import:foo.dll` an address came from. `PDB.section_contributions()`,
  `PDB.module_of()`.
- `S_PROCREF`/`S_LPROCREF` decoding: every procedure indexed from one stream.
  `PDB.proc_refs()`, `PDB.resolve_proc_ref()`.
- `S_CONSTANT` and `S_UDT` decoding. `PDB.constants()`, `PDB.udts()`.
- Thunks and trampolines. `PDB.thunks()`, `PDB.trampolines()`; `S_THUNK32`
  records now reach `functions()` with `source="thunk"`.
- Line information: `rva -> file:line` via the `/names` string table and the C13
  subsections. `PDB.lines()`, `PDB.string_table()`, `PDB.named_streams()`.
- Inlined functions from `S_INLINESITE`, with names resolved through the IPI
  stream. `PDB.inline_sites()`, `PDB.id_table()`.
- Truncated and malformed record streams are reported rather than silently
  ending a listing. `Diagnostics.truncations`, `Diagnostics.malformed_records`.
- A 32-bit `rust-lld` fixture, which is what shows the `code_publics` rule is
  not an x86_64 accident.
- `tools/fuzz.py`, which drives every public entry point over malformed input
  and fails if anything but `PdbError` escapes.
- Continuous integration: tests on 3.11–3.14 plus macOS and Windows, ruff, ty,
  an sdist round-trip, and fuzzing on every change and nightly.

### Changed

- **Requires Python 3.11 or newer.** 3.9 and 3.10 are no longer supported;
  3.9 has been end-of-life since October 2025.
- Development tooling moved from the `dev` extra to a PEP 735 dependency group.
  Install it with `pip install -e . --group dev`, not `pip install -e '.[dev]'`.
- `PDB.to_rva()` is public; it was `_rva`, which is retained as an alias.

### Fixed

- An OMAP table present without the original section table no longer
  double-translates an already-final address into one no symbol occupies.
- A present-but-empty section-header stream is treated as absent, so the Section
  Map fallback runs instead of every RVA silently coming back `None`.
- A malformed stream directory raises `MsfError` instead of leaking
  `struct.error`, and an unterminated module name no longer raises `EOFError`
  out of `PDB.open()`.
- A short IPI record no longer raises `EOFError` out of `PDB.inline_sites()`.
- `Function.module` is populated for thunk-created functions, which previously
  depended on a redundant proc or public happening to share the address.
