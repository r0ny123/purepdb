"""Check OMAP translation against Windows system binaries.

purepdb resolves a BBT-processed PDB's symbols against the *original* section
table in Optional Debug Header slot 10 and then translates through the address
map, so every rva it reports for such a file is a final, post-BBT address. That
is the one branch where ignoring a stream gives wrong answers rather than
missing ones -- on Win7 x64 ntdll, all 1961 exported functions land at a
different address after translation than before it -- and no fixture in this
repository can exercise it. Microsoft's BBT was never released, Syzygy's
`relink` never writes slot 10, and a vendor symbol-server PDB is not
redistributable, so it cannot be committed either. See `tests/data/README.md`.

What can be done is to check it, locally, against files the developer already
has. This is that check. Nothing it touches is redistributed: the images come
from a Windows installation, the PDBs from Microsoft's symbol server, and both
stay in a cache directory that is not tracked.

**The oracle is the export table.** A PE's exports are addresses in the shipped,
post-BBT image, produced by the linker rather than by anything in the PDB. So
comparing them against purepdb's translated addresses is independent evidence,
and the counterfactual is the point of it: the same comparison without applying
the map matches essentially nothing.

    python dev/validate_omap_against_windows.py ~/win-dlls --fetch

Recorded results. The six XP and Win7 pairs all carry slot 10, so BBT was still
in use for Win7. None of the twelve Win10 and Win11 pairs carries a single OMAP
entry, so the practice ended between the two -- which is why the counterfactual
below is scoped to the pairs that actually carry a map.

ntdll agrees on 99.8% to 100% of its exports on all three targets, which is the
result that matters: it is the module BBT rearranges most and the one whose PDB
carries the largest map. kernel32's residue is not disagreement about addresses
but about which address belongs to a name -- Win7 exports it through stubs, and
the offsets cluster hard (146 at exactly +8 on x64, 175 at exactly +13 on x86),
which is a calling convention rather than a translation error. A wrong
translation does not produce the same delta 175 times.

A second run in 2026-09, against images fetched from the symbol server rather
than an installation, and with the stubs *followed* (see `follow_thunk`) and an
export whose address the PDB names under another name counted as `alias`:
