"""Cross-check purepdb against llvm-pdbutil, record by record.

The suite in `tests/` must not need an LLVM toolchain, so the strongest
evidence this parser has -- agreement with the reference implementation -- can
only live outside it. That is what this script is: the comparisons that were
run by hand and reported in pull request descriptions, written down so anyone
can re-run them, and so a nightly job can fail when one stops holding.

    python dev/validate_against_llvm.py                 # tests/data/**/*.pdb
    python dev/validate_against_llvm.py path/to/one.pdb  # or a private corpus

The tool is found on PATH, or named by `--llvm-pdbutil` or `$LLVM_PDBUTIL`.
Exit status is 0 only when every file was read and every check agreed. It is 1
on a disagreement, on a file purepdb could not open (`--allow-unreadable` to
sweep a mixed corpus anyway), and on a corpus with no PDBs in it -- each of
those verified nothing, and a run that verified nothing must not print `ok`.
A missing `llvm-pdbutil` exits 0 with a message, so running this is never a
requirement; `--require-tool` makes it an error instead, which is what CI does.

Thirteen checks, over the subsystems whose accuracy was claimed in a PR
description and nowhere else:

    procs               S_*PROC32 name, address and code size
    publics             S_PUB32 name, address and function flag
    labels              S_LABEL32 name and address
    constants           S_CONSTANT name and value
    udts                S_UDT name and type index
    data                S_GDATA32/S_LDATA32 name, address and scope, each once
    thread locals       S_GTHREAD32/S_LTHREAD32 the same way
    thunks              S_THUNK32 name, address and size
    trampolines         S_TRAMPOLINE kind, size, source and target section
    contributions       the Section Contribution table
    inline sites        each inlined body, its name, and every code range
    module attribution  the module each function is attributed to
    lines               every file:line and the address it starts at

Eight things about llvm-pdbutil's output are worth knowing before trusting a
comparison against it, all of them handled here:

  * `dump -l` prints line blocks under modules whose debug stream is 0xFFFF,
    repeating the previous module's blocks. Those modules hold no line info at
    all; `dump --modules` is what says so, and their blocks are skipped.
  * it renders the line number 0xF00F00 -- "do not step into this" -- as the
    label `NSI` rather than as a number.
  * a symbol address prints as `segment:offset` with **both parts in decimal**,
    while a line block's header prints **both parts in hex**. Same dump, two
    bases, and neither is labelled.
  * the section-contribution row is `SC[...]` for the Ver60 table and
    `SC2[...]` for the V2 one, which purepdb also reads.
  * a file heading is `path (MD5: ...)` or `path (no checksum)`; a line block
    is `line/addr entries` or `line/column/addr entries`.
  * `--section-contribs` needs the section-header stream, and exits 1 with
    "PDB does not contain the requested image section header type" on a PDB
    that has no slot 5. That is the reference implementation declining to
    answer, not a disagreement, so the two checks reading that dump are
    skipped for such a file rather than failing it.
  * it opens the IPI stream only when the PDB info stream advertises the
    feature code saying there is one. A file whose feature codes were dropped
    reports `Has IDs: false` with a perfectly good IPI in stream 4, and every
    item id then resolves against the *TPI*, printing a type name where an
    inlinee's function name belongs. The name is left out of the inline-site
    comparison for such a file; the id and the ranges are still compared.
  * its inline-site cursor moves past the length of a standalone
    `ChangeCodeLength` and *not* past the one fused into
    `ChangeCodeLengthAndCodeOffset`, so a file using the fused opcode has
    every range after the first printed short by the lengths before it. Ranges
    are therefore rebuilt from the deltas rather than read off the absolute
    offsets -- and llvm's own cursor is tracked alongside, so that if this
    stops being true the script says so instead of comparing quietly.

A module heading, a section-contribution row or a line entry this script does
not recognise raises `ParseError` rather than being skipped: mis-reading one of
those silently reattributes or drops whole blocks of records.

The record walk is not strict in the same way -- a line that is neither a
module heading nor an `S_*` record header is treated as a continuation of the
record above it, because that is what the multi-line record bodies are. So a
change to the record header format does not raise; it empties that side of the
comparison, which is caught instead by the rule that a check comparing nothing
fails the run.
