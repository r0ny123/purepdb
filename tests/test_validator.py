`dev/validate_against_llvm.py` is the only thing verifying purepdb against a

`ok` and returned 0 passed ruff, ty and the whole suite. These cover the
guards that decide whether a run may call itself agreement -- the parts that,
if they rot, turn the nightly job green over a comparison it never made.
