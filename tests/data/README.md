# Groundtruth fixtures

Real compiler output, paired with the image the PDB describes. The pairing is
the point: `tests/_pe.py` reads the image with nothing but `struct` and never
consults the PDB, so when the two agree on a section table or an export address
that agreement is evidence rather than a shared assumption.

These files are in the repository but excluded from the sdist and wheel, so
installing purepdb does not pull down 12 MB of binaries. `test_groundtruth.py`
skips when they are absent.

| fixture | toolchain | what it covers |
|---|---|---|
| `sqlite/x86/sqlite3.{dll,pdb}` | MSVC `link.exe`, VS2019-era, x86 | 3539 procs, 685 publics, 277 exports, cdecl underscore-decorated aliases |
| `sqlite/x64/sqlite3.{dll,pdb}` | MSVC `link.exe`, VS2019-era, x64 | 3522 procs, 660 publics, 277 exports, C++ decorated aliases |
| `rustpe/rust_pe_symbols_msvc.{exe,pdb}` | `rust-lld`, rustc 1.97.1, x64 | 248 procs, 451 publics, EH funclets, and 143 code publics with the function flag *clear* |
| `rustpe32/rust_pe_symbols_i686.{exe,pdb}` | `rust-lld`, rustc 1.94.1, i686 | 2 procs, 5 publics, 13 inline sites, and 4 code publics with the flag clear — the `code_publics` rule at 32 bits |
| `rustpe32/rust_pe_symbols_i686_no_slot5.pdb` | `rustpe32/` with slot 5 cleared | same counts and RVAs as `rustpe32/`; Section Map fallback on a committed file (issue #25) |
| `xp/ntdll.pdb` | Microsoft symbol server, Windows XP SP2 | 37 118 OMAP entries, 2 213 functions from publics; genuine BBT-processed PDB (issue #25) |

The rustpe fixtures are the ones that pin the `code_publics` rule: `link.exe`
sets `PUBLIC_FLAG_FUNCTION` on every code public, `rust-lld` does not, and
without the executable-section fallback the x64 binary loses 36% of its
functions and the i686 one loses 4 of 6.

What decides the flag turned out not to be the architecture or the linker. It
is the contributing object's COFF symbol type: `rust-lld` sets the flag for
every symbol rustc and clang emit, and leaves it clear for symbols defined in
hand-written assembly, which declares no function type. The x64 fixture's
unflagged publics are all CRT-shim and import symbols for that reason. The
i686 fixture reproduces it deliberately and small enough to read in full —
`stubs.s` beside it is four assembly stubs and nothing else.

## Provenance

**sqlite3** — built with MSVC from sqlite's own sources, which are public domain.
Image bases `0x10000000` (x86) and `0x180000000` (x64).

**rust_pe_symbols_msvc** — our own build, regenerable from the `main.rs` beside
it. rustc 1.97.1 (`8bab26f4f`, 2026-07-14), release profile, `debuginfo=2`,
`CARGO_INCREMENTAL=0`:

```bash
cargo build --release --target x86_64-pc-windows-msvc
```

Built on Linux: `rust-lld` plus mingw-w64 import libraries and a small
locally-written CRT shim, so no Microsoft-licensed material is involved. **It is
not runnable** — the CRT symbols (`mainCRTStartup`, `__chkstk`, `floor`, …) are
stubs sufficient to link but not to execute. That is deliberate; the file exists
to be parsed and disassembled. The Rust function bodies come from the same
prebuilt std rlibs a Windows-hosted build would link, so the code under test is
representative.

**rust_pe_symbols_i686** — our own build, regenerable with the `build.sh` beside
it. rustc 1.94.1 (`e408947bf`, 2026-03-25), `-O -C debuginfo=2 -C panic=abort`,
linked by `rust-lld` with `/nodefaultlib`. It is `#![no_std] #![no_main]`, so it
links against no CRT and no import library at all, and `stubs.s` is assembled by
clang — no Microsoft-licensed material is involved. **It is not runnable**: the
stubs return constants. It exists to be parsed. `hash_round` and `mix_pair` are
`#[inline(always)]`, which is where its 13 inline sites come from.

**rust_pe_symbols_i686_no_slot5** — `rustpe32/rust_pe_symbols_i686.pdb` with
Optional Debug Header slot 5 cleared. The companion image is
`rustpe32/rust_pe_symbols_i686.exe`. No toolchain available here emits a PDB
without slot 5 at link time; this is the committed substitute for issue #25.

**ntdll.pdb** — fetched from Microsoft's symbol server for Windows XP SP2
(`A618C674A4FC40F5B1781029C2C7F68E2`). No companion image is in the repository;
OMAP fixtures are checked in `test_omap.py`, not the PE oracle. This is the
first genuinely BBT-processed PDB in the corpus (issue #25).

## Adding to this set

The shapes that once needed a fixture are now covered:

* **32-bit rust-lld** — `rustpe32/`, above.
* **No section-header stream** — `rustpe32/rust_pe_symbols_i686_no_slot5.pdb`,
  above, plus the runtime derivation in `test_sectionmap.py` on every other
  fixture.
* **OMAP tables** — `xp/ntdll.pdb`, above, plus the runtime derivation in
  `test_omap.py`.

Keep fixtures small, keep them own builds or public-domain sources, and record
the toolchain here — a fixture whose provenance is unclear cannot stay in a
public repository.
