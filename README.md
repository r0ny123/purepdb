# purepdb

A minimal, dependency-free pure-Python parser for Microsoft PDB debug-info
files. Purpose-built to answer one question well: **what are the functions in
this binary and where are their entry points?**

It is *not* a reimplementation of `llvm-pdbutil` — it is a thin vertical slice
through the same format stack, written from the published format
documentation. See [NOTICE](NOTICE) for provenance and prior art.

## Install

```bash
uv pip install -e . --group dev   # pytest, ruff and ty
```

Runtime dependencies: none. Python 3.11+.

## Usage

```python
from purepdb import PDB

pdb = PDB.open("app.pdb")

for fn in pdb.functions():
    print(hex(fn.rva or 0), fn.name)
    # fn.segment, fn.offset, fn.code_size, fn.source, fn.aliases, fn.module
```

`module` is the linker input the address came from — an `.obj` path, a library
member, or `Import:foo.dll` for an import thunk — taken from DBI's Section
Contribution table. It is what separates library code from application code
without guessing from the name: 3453 of sqlite3 x86's 3620 functions come from
`sqlite3.lo`, the rest from the CRT and from import thunks.

`rva` is **image-relative**. Add the PE image base yourself if you need virtual
addresses.

`source` is `"proc"`, `"public"` or `"thunk"`, naming the record the entry came
from. Incremental-link trampolines are *not* in this list — they carry no name,
so `pdb.trampolines()` reports them separately, as a code range plus the address
it jumps to.

`aliases` holds the other names at the same entry point. Linkers fold identical
bodies (`/OPT:ICF`, and rust-lld by default), so one address legitimately
carries several correct names; `fn.names` gives all of them with `fn.name`
first. On sqlite3 x86 that is 438 of 3620 functions, worst case 4 names.

`pdb.lines()` yields `(rva, file, line)` for every source line the PDB records —
70157 of them in sqlite3 x86, across 133 files. It is a generator; the file
names come from the `/names` stream, which `pdb.named_streams()` locates.

CLI:

```
purepdb functions app.pdb    # name + entry-point RVA
purepdb publics   app.pdb
purepdb info      app.pdb
purepdb diagnose  app.pdb    # what the PDB contains, and why a listing is thin
```

## When a listing comes back short

Every failure mode this parser has on real files produces an *empty result*
rather than an exception, so `diagnose()` exists to tell them apart:

```
$ purepdb diagnose app.pdb
proc records       : 0
public records     : 7400
WARNING: no procedure records in 285 module streams (dominant kinds:
0x1167x110161, S_TRAMPOLINEx4610, ...); function names can only come from the
7400 public records. This is what /DEBUG:FASTLINK and some pre-2010 toolchains
produce
```

The CLI prints these warnings automatically after `functions` and `publics`.

## Two things worth knowing about publics

**They live in the symbol-record stream.** DBI's `PublicStreamIndex` names a
*hash* stream holding offsets, not records — scanning it for `S_PUB32` finds
nothing at all, silently. `purepdb.gsi` documents the layout; the publics stream
is used only for its address map, which supplies address ordering.

**The function flag is not reliable across linkers.** `link.exe` sets
`PUBLIC_FLAG_FUNCTION` on every code public (all 438 of sqlite3 x86's).
`rust-lld` leaves it clear on 143 of 280, including `mainCRTStartup` and
`__chkstk`. So a public also counts as a function when it resolves into an
executable section — worth 36% of the functions in a Rust PE.

**This means `functions()` deliberately returns more than the flag alone would.**
On the Rust fixture, 164 entries are public-sourced while only 142 publics carry
the function flag. The extra ones are real code — every one resolves inside
`.text`, verified against the image — but a consumer that previously filtered on
`PublicSymbol.is_function` will see entries it does not expect. Pass
`functions(code_publics=False)` for flag-only behaviour, and note that
`public_symbols()` is unfiltered either way, so `is_function` still means exactly
what the record says.

## Inlined functions

An inlined body has no entry point, so it has no procedure record and no public
— `functions()` cannot see it by construction. `pdb.inline_sites()` reports them
separately, each with its name, the code ranges it occupies inside its caller,
and which function that is:

```python
for site in pdb.inline_sites():
    print(hex(site.rva or 0), site.name, "inlined into", site.parent)
```

On the Rust fixture that is 3797 sites against 248 procedure records — fifteen
inlined bodies for every function with an entry point, and the largest naming
gap the parser had.

## Scope

**Supported:** MSF 7.00 container; PDB info stream; DBI stream (module list,
section contributions, publics/symbol-record streams, optional debug header);
CodeView `S_PUB32`, `S_GPROC32`/`S_LPROC32` (and `_ID` variants),
`S_GDATA32`/`S_LDATA32`, `S_PROCREF`/`S_LPROCREF`, `S_CONSTANT`, `S_UDT`,
`S_THUNK32`, `S_TRAMPOLINE`, `S_INLINESITE` with its binary annotations;
section-header table for `segment:offset -> RVA`, with DBI's Section Map as the
fallback when that table is absent; OMAP address translation for images whose
code was moved after linking; the named stream map, the `/names` string table
and the C13 `DEBUG_S_LINES` / `DEBUG_S_FILECHECKSUMS` subsections for `rva ->
file:line`; the IPI id records that name an inlinee.

**Not supported:** TPI type decoding, column info, demangling (names come back
raw). The IPI stream is read only for the names inlined bodies refer to by id;
no type is decoded. `/DEBUG:FASTLINK` PDBs yield publics only, and say so.

Where the section-header stream is missing, addresses are rebuilt from the
Section Map, which records segment sizes but no addresses. `diagnose()` says
when that happened, because the result is a reconstruction — taking the stream
away from each fixture leaves every function at the address it had before, but
it assumes the default `0x1000` section alignment.

## Tests

```bash
.venv/bin/python -m pytest -q
```

```bash
make lint    # ruff, then ty
make fuzz    # malformed input must not escape as an exception
```

Two layers. Synthetic tests build MSF/PDB byte streams with a builder
independent of the reader, so they exercise a real serialise→parse round trip.
Golden tests run against real `link.exe` and `rust-lld` output in `tests/data/`,
32- and 64-bit, and cross-check against the companion PE image — section table,
and the address of every exported function after following its `jmp` thunk. The
PE reader in `tests/_pe.py` is stdlib-only and never consults the PDB, so
agreement is evidence rather than a shared assumption.

A third layer runs outside pytest. `tools/fuzz.py` drives every public entry
point over random, structurally-corrupted and bit-flipped input, and fails if
anything other than `PdbError` escapes -- the contract a caller writes
`except PdbError` against. GitHub Actions runs a short pass on every change
and a longer one nightly with a rotating seed; a failing input is saved and
uploaded as an artefact so it can be replayed.

## Releasing

Versions follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html),
and [`CHANGELOG.md`](CHANGELOG.md) follows
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/). What the version
number covers is stated at the top of that file: the API in `__all__`, not the
count of symbols a release happens to recover from a given PDB.

To cut a release:

1. Move the `Unreleased` entries under a new `## [x.y.z] - YYYY-MM-DD`
   heading, and update the link definitions at the bottom of the file.
2. Set the same version in `pyproject.toml`.
3. Tag it: `git tag -a vx.y.z -m 'purepdb x.y.z'` and push the tag.

Pushing the tag runs `.github/workflows/release.yml`, which builds the sdist
and wheel, checks their metadata with twine, **fails if the tag and the
packaged version disagree**, runs the suite against what it built, and
attaches the artefacts to the GitHub release for that tag — creating the
release with generated notes if it does not already exist.

Publishing to PyPI stays manual (`make publish`). Automating it needs either a
stored token or a Trusted Publisher configured against the repository, which
is a maintainer decision rather than something a workflow should assume.

`tests/data/` is in the repository but excluded from the sdist and wheel, so
installing purepdb does not pull down 12 MB of binaries. Those tests skip when
the data is absent — clone the repo to run them.

The suite needs no external tool. Results are also cross-checked
record-by-record against `llvm-pdbutil` during development, where that toolchain
is available.
