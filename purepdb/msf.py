"""Multi-Stream File (MSF) container reader.

An MSF file is the on-disk container for a PDB. It is a block-based
file system: the file is divided into fixed-size blocks, and each logical
"stream" is stored as an ordered list of (possibly non-contiguous) blocks.

Layout (MSF 7.00 / "big" MSF, the only format shipped since VS 2015):

    +----------------+  offset 0
    | SuperBlock     |  56 bytes: magic + 6 x uint32
    +----------------+
    | ... blocks ... |
    +----------------+

The SuperBlock's BlockMapAddr points at a block that holds an array of
uint32 block indices; those blocks concatenated (truncated to
NumDirectoryBytes) form the *stream directory*, which describes every
stream in the file.

Format reference: the MSF container layout as described in LLVM's PDB
documentation (https://llvm.org/docs/PDB/MsfFile.html) and Microsoft's own
published PDB sources. This is an independent implementation; see NOTICE.
