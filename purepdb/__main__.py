"""Command-line interface: python -m purepdb <command> <file.pdb>

Every listing is one record per line with stable leading columns, so `grep`,
`sort` and `awk` work on the output directly. Record counts and warnings go to
stderr, as does the usage text, so a redirected stdout holds records and
nothing else. `diagnose` is a report rather than a listing: its output *is*
stdout, warnings included.

A name can hold anything, including spaces -- `std::rt::lang_start::closure$0
<tuple$<> >` is one name -- so **the name is the last field on its line**, and
nothing is printed after it. The one line that carries two names, an inline
site and the function it was inlined into, separates them with a tab, which a
name cannot contain because every unprintable character in one is escaped: a
name holding a newline would otherwise put a record on two lines, and one
holding an escape sequence would drive the terminal. A backslash is left
alone, so `a\x0ab` on screen is either of two names -- readable paths are
worth more here than a mapping that can be inverted. Names are otherwise
printed exactly as the PDB stores them -- decorated, mangled, or empty.

An address the PDB cannot resolve prints as `??????` rather than as a number
that would be wrong.
